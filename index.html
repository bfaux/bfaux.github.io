                <p> <img src="Images/bryanwebsitepro.jpeg" alt="Bryan J. Faux" /> I am a journalism student currently studying at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</a> but I originally wanted to be a musical theater actor. I've been participating in theater at various venues in the community for the majority of my life. I studied acting and voice on and off for many years. I was an active performer at the Vam York Theater in Gainesville, Florida for the past six years where I still ocassionally volunteer. I have always loved the collaborative nature of theater and the way people can come together, connect to each other and audience, as well as create art. I love disussing  art and culture and survey their impact on society. I found myself often reading <em>The New York Times</em> reviews of Broadway shows and constantly wanting a place to weigh in on the state of contemporary American theater. With the digital age of social media, podcasts, and blogs everyone has something to say about popular culture. I realized I wanted to be in a profession where I could give my opinion and possibly even have my opinion matter.  I want to be a part of the discussion in unique and contempoary ways and connect with others through that discussion.</p>
