                <h1>The Fauxworthy Blog</h1>
                
                <p>Fauxworthy is a blog I started to give my thoughts about different pop culture topics on an ongoing basis. In some posts I review movies and television shows and in other posts I write about a cultural figure or event that impresses or influences me. When I see a new movie or play I always want to know about other people's reactions to it.  I try to write about things I find interesting or outside the box, things that might not be found on other blogs with a similar focus. I am very open to comments and discussion and encourage people to visit the blog and say something about what I have written.<br><br>Fauxworthy can be found <a href="http://www.bfaux.wordpress.com">here</a>.</p>
