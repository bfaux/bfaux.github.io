                <h1>Vine Gives Users A Quick Laugh, (Cont.)</h1>
                
                <p> <img src="images/vine.png" alt="Vine Logo"/>Sanders participates regularly in community theater and says he is lucky to have so many actor friends that can participate in his vines.  He explained that he keeps in touch with other popular viners through Twitter and even met cast members from "So You Think You Can Dance" on tour after corresponding with them on Twitter and sharing a mutual admiration for each others' talents. Thomas has several vines that feature his smooth, jazzy, baritone voice.  His most popular vines seem to be the ones that people can relate to.  You can watch them and they produce the kind of laughter that comes from recognizing something you are all too familiar with.<br> 
                    <br>Vine has made it easy for users to create content.  The app has a clean, simple design and users aren't burdened with tricky editing techniques. You can film, edit, and produce content almost immediately.  This is a bold step forward for an age of do-it-yourself media creation.  YouTube videos are fairly easy to make but can be time consuming to edit if the video is elaborate.  After Vine surged in popularity, Instagram responded by adding video to it's photo sharing application, allowing users to produce 15 second videos.  Initially people were saying that this could be the death of Vine, but that clearly hasn't been the case.  People have simply embraced both platforms.  With the technology of today people can make movies, publish stories or articles, and record original music efficiently and inexpensively.  Technology is carrying us into a future where content is generated and distributed by users who no longer have to rely on larger companies for the resources to do so.<br> 
                    <br>I asked Thomas if he thought Vine would last or rapidly fall into obscurity like some other fads.  While he believes it is hard to say, he says "it's fun while it lasts".  We discussed the way technology has changed our lives so dramatically and how his internet popularity could not have happened without social media.  He just wants to keep making people laugh with his vines.  Thomas says he has recieved many positive messages of appreciation for his work.  Fans constantly write messages to him online to tell him that his vines brightened their day or connected them to a family member through a shared enjoyment of his videos.  He likes to respond back to his followers using Twitter so they know he appreciates their interest in his vines.  Every Sunday he posts a shout to fans in the form of a song and includes the hashtag #shoutoutsunday.<br>
                    <br>Thomas hopes to collaborate with many other Vine stars in the future.  He has already worked with Marcus and Cody Johns (two very popular Vine stars) on several "collab vines".  But Thomas says he wouldn't mind if the Vine craze dissolved tomorrow. "I'm not in this to get famous,   I inquired about his aspirations for the future and what he dreams of doing beyond the quick, looping, flashes of energy and humor that have propelled him to internet stardom.  He expressed his desire to work in theater some day or pursue voice acting, a talent he often puts to use in his vine videos.  He says some of his fans online have also told him he could be a successful voice actor, which is a great confidence booster.  But for now he's just happy that people have taken notice of his antics and he will keep making Vines as long as people keep watching them.<br>

                    <br> Below is the full audio of my interviw with Thomas. It is a casual conversation similar to a podcast.  The audio is about 48:00 in length.  I have also included a news story from Fox News in Phoenix, Arizona that is made up of vines.  Thomas has a brief appearance in the video.<br></p>
