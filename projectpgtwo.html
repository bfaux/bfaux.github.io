                <h1>Vine Gives Users A Quick Laugh, (Cont.)</h1>
                
                <p> <img src="images/vine.png" alt="Vine Logo"/>Vine has made it easy for users to create content.  The app has a clean simple design and users aren't burdened with tricky editing techniques. You can film, edit, and produce content almost immediately.  This is a bold step forward for an age of do-it-yourself media creation.  You can make movies, publish stories or articles, and record original music efficiently and inexpensively.  Technology is carrying us into a future where content is generated and distributed by users who no longer have to rely on large corporatons.<br> 
                    <br>I asked Thomas if he thought Vine would last or fall into obscurity and while he believes it is hard to say, he says it's fun while it lasts.  We discussed the way technology has changed our lives so dramatically and how none of this would have happened without social media.  He just wants to keep making people laugh with his vines.  Thomas says he has recieved many positive messages of appreciation for his work.  People have written to him online and said that his Vines helped to brighten their day or connect them to a family member through shared enjoyment of his vines.  He likes to respond back to his followers so they know he appreciates their interest in his work.<br>
                    <br>He hopes to collaborate with many other Vine stars in the future.  He has already worked with Marcus and Cody Johns (two very popular Vine stars) on several "collab vines".  Thomas says he wouldn't mind if the Vine craze dissolved tomorrow.  I inquired about his aspirations for the future and what he dreams of doing beyond the quick, looping, flashes of energy and humor that have propelled him to internet stardom.  He expressed his desire to work in theater some day or pursue voice acting.  But for now he's just happy that people have taken notice of his antics and he will keep making Vines as long as people keep watching them.<br>
