                <h1>Vine Gives Users A Quick Laugh, (Cont.)</h1>
                
                <p> <img src="images/vine.png" alt="Vine Logo"/>I asked Thomas if he thought Vine would last or fall into obscurity and while he thinks it's hard to tell right now, he says it's fun while it lasts.  We discussed the way technology has changed our lives so dramatically and how none of this would have happened without social media.  He just wants to keep making people laugh with his vines.  He hopes to collaborate with many other Vine stars in the future and wouldn't mind if the Vine craze dissolved tomorrow.  I asked him what he dreams of doing that is unrelated to Vine and he expressed his desire to work as an actor professionally or pursue voice acting.  But for now he's just happy that people have taken notice of his antics and he will keep making Vines as long as people keep watching them.     </p>
