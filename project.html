                <h1>Vine Gives Users A Quick Laugh</h1>
                
                <p> <img src="images/vine.png" alt="Vine Logo"/>With the rise of technology and the dominance of social media in popular culture, fads come and go rapidly.  Life goes by at a clip and it becomes difficult to keep up with everything that is being thrown at us.  In this modern, fast paced world something can suddenly rise in popularity and then vanish just as quickly.  Furthermore, mobile devices ensure that the internet, especially social media, is accessed all the time.  There are numerous examples of internet crazes that have exhibited staying power such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter although it is always difficult to predict how long these kinds of things will last.<br>
                    <br>Enter Vine, a smartphone app from the makers of Twitter that started at the beginning of the year and has steadily risen in popularity.  Vine allows users to create six-second mini-movies that run on an endless loop.  At first the appeal of such an app may be difficult to understand but "viners" have quickly learned that the short six-second format calls for a certain degree of creativity and innovation to land a punchline or make a point.  The app was originally available only on iOS devices, then it rolled out to Android, then after much speculation it finally became available for Windows Phone last month.  It seems to have really taken off with a younger generation and the videos come from all over the world. Vine content mostly includes comedy, short sketches, singing, and capturing pranks or live events in bite-sized pieces.  A detailed article from <strong>The Guardian</strong> written by Dominic Rushe, proclaims that Vine has "also provided a renaissance for stop-motion animators, some of whom are making astonishingly complex pieces using the simplest of tools".  According to <strong>The Guardian</strong> article Vine currently has about 40 million users.<br>
                    <br>Vine has even become useful for journalism. According to <strong>Mashable</strong>, "the app got its first foray into breaking news in April when users captured footage of explosions during the Boston Marathon bombings".  Journalists are experimenting with Vine to deliver quick, simple, and effective news stories.  The app is very user-friendly, the only real limitation is the length of time the can final video can be. As with Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter advertisements have recently begun cropping up throughout Vine as well.  According to <strong>blog.brandsonvine.com</strong> companies like Dunkin Donuts and Trident have used Vine to advertise their products.  Even a mini movie trailer came in the form of a Vine promoting <em>The Wolverine</em>. Vine is a perfect platform for someone wishing to call attention to a product or service in a quick concise way.<br>
                    <br>Because so many people have access to social media on a regualar basis, internet memes, apps, and viral videos, can become a phenomenon quickly and unexpectedly.  Vine has created a number of internet stars similar to what has happened when many YouTube videos go viral. Some viners have gathered millions of followers.  One Vine sensation, fifteen year old Nash Grier, was featured on ABC News in October 2013 after amassing 1.4 million followers.  The news anchor Josh Elliot claimed Grier to be "more popular than Justin Bieber". There are several of the Vine stars who have thousands to millions of followers and the fan bases just keep growing.  I recently sat down with viner Thomas Sanders who has 1.8 million followers on the social media app to discuss how his vines became famous and why he keeps making them.<br>
                    <br>Thomas is close to reaching 2 million followers on Vine, which he says is very "humbling" and he doesn't make vines to "get famous".  He just really wants people to like what he makes and as long as it keeps being fun and people respond to it he'll continue.  "Making just one person smile" is enough to keep him going.  Having been introduced to Vine when it was still in it's infancy, Thomas told me that he originally just played around with Vine, making silly videos and experimenting, not expecting any substantial reaction to it.  Then one day he just "tried something funny" and his Vines started catching on.  When he originally tried doing his now famous impression of Stewie from <em>Family Guy</em>, he said at first it was "a really bad impression" but people seemed to like it.<br>
                    <br>According to Thomas he was surprised at reaching just 500 followers let alone reaching 1 million in about 7 months.  He claims that sometimes the best vines take very little time to get the perfect take, where some of the more the complicated ones don't always live up to expectations.  He says his standards of quality for his own work are "ridiculous" and sometimes he will choose not to post something if it can't even make hime laugh. I asked him to elaborate on the appeal of Vine and his reponse was this, "it's more impressive" to make people laugh with "just six seconds of material".  When speaking to <strong>The Guardian</strong> one of the co-founders of Vine, Dom Hofmann had similar things to say noting that, "like Twitter and its 140 characters, Vine's limitations have been its making.  He went on to say, "If you give somebody constraints, it's easier to be creative".  Hofmann also noted in <strong>The Guardian</strong> that when the app was first launched in January 2013 that the creators "were blown away by how quickly it resonated with people and by how quickly people pushed the boundaries of creativity".  <br>
