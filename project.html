                <p> <img src="images/vine.png" alt="Vine Logo"/>With the rise of technology and the dominance of social media in popular culture, fads come and go rapidly.  Life goes by at a clip and it becomes difficult to keep with everything that is being thrown at us.

Vine has created a number of internet stars. Some have millions of followers.  One Vine sensation, fifteen year old Nash Grier, was featured on ABC News in October 2013 after amassing 1.4 million followers.
