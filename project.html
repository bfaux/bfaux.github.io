                <h1>Vine Gives Users A Quick Laugh</h1>
                
                <p> <img src="images/vine.png" alt="Vine Logo"/>With the rise of technology and the dominance of social media in popular culture, fads come and go rapidly.  Life goes by at a clip and it becomes difficult to keep up with everything that is being thrown at us.  In this modern, fast paced world something can suddenly rise in popularity and then vanish just as quickly.  There are numerous examples of internet crazes that have exhibited staying power such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, however it always difficult to tell how long these kinds of things will last.<br>
                    <br>Enter Vine, a smartphone app from the makers of Twitter that started at the beginning of the year and has steadily risen in popularity.  Vine allows users to create six-second mini-movies that run on an endless loop.  Perhaps the appeal is hard to see at first but "viners" quickly learned that the short six-second format calls for a certain degree of creativity and innovation to land a punchline or make a point. Vine content mostly includes comedy, short sketches, singing, and capturing pranks or live events in bite-sized pieces.  A detailed article from <strong>The Gaurdian</strong> written by Dominic Rushe explains that Vine has "also provided a renaissance for stop-motion animators, some of whom are making astonishingly complex pieces using the simplest of tools".  According to <strong>The Guardian</strong> article Vine currently has about 40 million users.<br>
                    <br>Vine has even become useful for journalism. According to <strong>mashable.com</strong>, "the app got its first foray into breaking news in April when users captured footage of explosions during the Boston Marathon bombings".  Journalists are experimenting with Vine to deliver quick, simple, and effective news stories.  The app is very user-friendly, the only real limitation is the length of time the can final video can be. As with Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter advertisements have recently begun cropping up throughout Vine as well.  According to <strong>blog.brandsonvine.com</strong> companies like Dunkin Donuts and Trident have used Vine to advertise their products.  Even a mini movie trailer came in the form of a Vine promoting <em>The Wolverine</em>. Vine is a perfect platform for someone wishing to call attention to a product or service in a quick concise way.<br>
                    <br>Because so many people have access to social media, internet memes, apps, and viral videos, something can become a phenomenon quickly and unexpectedly.  Vine has created a number of internet stars. Some have millions of followers.  One Vine sensation, fifteen year old Nash Grier, was featured on ABC News in October 2013 after amassing 1.4 million followers.  I recently sat down with viner Thomas Sanders who has 1.8 million followers on the social media app to discuss how his vines became famous and why he keeps making them.<br>
                    <br>Thomas Sanders is close to reaching 2 million followers on Vine, which he says is very "humbling" and he doesn't make vines to "get famous".  He just really wants people to like what he makes and as long as it keeps being fun he'll continue.  Having been introduced to Vine when it was still in it's infancy, Thomas told me that originally he just played around with Vine, making silly videos, not expecting any reaction to it.  Then one day he just "tried something funny" and his Vines started catching on.  When he originally tried doing his now famous impression of Stewie from <em>Family Guy</em>, he said at first it was "a really bad impression" but people liked it.   <br>
                    <br>According to Thomas he was surprised at reaching just 500 followers let alone reaching 1 million in about 7 months.  He claims that sometimes the best vines take very little time to get the perfect take, where some of the more the complicated ones don't always live up to expectations.  I asked him to elaborate on the appeal of Vine and his reponse was this, "it's more impressive" to make people laugh with "just six seconds of material".  When Speaking to <strong>The Gaurdian</strong> one of the co-founders of Vine Dom Hofmann had similar things to say noting that, "like Twitter and its 140 characters, Vine's limitations have been its making.  If you give somebody constraints, it's easier to be creative," Hofmann said.  Hofmann also noted in <strong>The Gaurdian</strong> that when the app was first launched in January 2013 that the creators "were blown away by how quickly it resonated with people and by how quickly people pushed the boundaries of creativity".  <br>
                    <br>Thomas participates regularly in community theater and spoke of how fortunate he is to have so many actor friends that can participate in his vines.  He explained that he keeps in touch with other popular viners through Twitter and even met cast members from "So You Think You Can Dance" on tour after corresponding with them on Twitter and sharing a mutual admiration for each others' talents. Thomas has created several vines that showcase his smooth, jazzy, baritone voice.  Thomas' most popular vines seem to be the ones that people can relate to.  You can watch them and laugh the kind of laughter that comes from recognizing something you are all too familiar with.</p>
