                <h1>Vine Gives Users A Quick Laugh</h1>

                <p>With the rise of technology and the dominance of social media in popular culture, fads come and go rapidly.  In the modern, fast paced world something can suddenly rise in popularity and then vanish just as quickly.  There are numerous examples of internet crazes that have exhibited staying power such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter but it always difficult to tell how long these things can last.  Enter Vine, a smartphone app from the makers of Twitter that was started at the beginning of the year and has steadily risen in popularity.  Vine allows users to create six-second mini-movies that run on an endless loop.  Perhaps the appeal is hard to see at first but "viners" quickly learned that the short six-second format calls for a certain degree of creativity to land a punchline or make a point. </p>
