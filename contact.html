                <p>I am a journalism student currently studying at the University of Florida but I originally wanted to be a musical theater actor. I've been participating in theater at various venues in the community for the majority of my life.  I studied acting and voice on and off for many years. I was an active performer at the Vam York Theater in Gainesville, Fl for the past six years where I still ocassionally volunteer.  I have always loved the collaborative nature of theater and the way people can come together to connect as well as create art.  I found myself often reading New York Times reviews of Broadway shows and constantly wanting a place to weigh in on the state of contemporary American theater. With the digital age of social media, podcasts, and blogs everyone has something to say about popular culture    </p>
